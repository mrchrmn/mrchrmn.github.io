When I wanted to get back into 3D I decided the best way to learn was to make a short film, and so I made Kicker. After the initial idea I read up on film theory, cinematography, editing before actually learning a 3D software, and then started to build the models and animate them. The whole process from idea to finish (ie.</description></item></channel></rss>
